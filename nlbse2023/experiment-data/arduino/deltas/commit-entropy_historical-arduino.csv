The yyMMdd string that the sketch archiver tool uses to format archive
names was being localized (i.e. was wrapped in _()).  This gave an
error on startup (and the Arduino software would fail to launch), if
someone translated the string to something that wasn't a valid date
format.  Since this is an internal string, it shouldn't be translated.

Previously, this relied on an (ugly, avr-specific) magic default for the
compiler.path variable, set by the IDE. This allowed the IDE to fall
back to a system-wide toolchain when no bundled toolchain was found (by
making compiler.path empty).

However,
 - this only worked for avr, not sam,
 - this worked only for gcc, a system-wide avrdude would break on the
   avrdude.conf path in platform.txt, and

This would mean that automatic system-wide fallback didn't work in all
situations, so you'd still have to modify platform.txt (or create
platform.local.txt). Since doing that explictly is the most reliable
way, this commit removes the partial-working ability to do this
automatically.

Note that the code to automatically set compiler.path is still kept
around, in case third-party hardware still relies on this. At some
point, this code should be removed, but for now it just shows a warning

In preferences files, platform-specific versions can be indicated by a
.linux, .windows or .macos suffix on the key name. Previously, these
keys were loaded as normal and then afterwards, all keys were scanned
after loading them and any platform-specific versions replaced the
regular ones.

However, this means that these platform-specific versions get an
unexpected form of priority. Normally, when a single key is set twice,
the latter overrides the first. However, the platform-specific values
could override the regular versions, even when the regular version
occurs later in the file.

This problem was particularly confusing when using the new
platform.local.txt: a regular preference in platform.local.txt did not
override a platform-specific preference in platform.txt.

This commit changes behaviour to process these suffixes directly as they
are read from the preference files. If a suffix for the current platform
is found, the line is processed as if the suffix was not present. If a
suffix for another platform is found, the line is ignored altogether.

This can slightly change the way preferences files are parsed, but as
long as platform-specific preferences are defined after the
corresponding regular preferences, the behaviour should be the same.",2014-04-14 15:35:33+02:00,5.503620154611575,0.8377079319114219,6.928521564002008,0.8789591918110414,6.78168828571816,0.8745050503732255,6.707401168766673,0.8718284967297627,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

If a variant supplied source files, these would be included in core.a
before. However, object files from core.a would only actually be
included in the build if they supplied a symbol for a strong reference
that was still missing.

In practice, this meant that a variant source file that only defines
interrupt handlers, or only defines strong versions of functions that
already had weak versions available, was not included.

By moving the variant .o files out of core.a and including them in the
build directly, this problem is solved.

Furthermore, the compilation of variant files is moved to after the
generation of core.a, to make it clearer in the code and verbose output

Previously, the --board and --port arguments were stored in a variable
first and only processed later. Now, the arguments are processed right
away.

This does mean that the arguments are processed when the GUI is not yet
initialized, which caused problems with calling onBoardOrPortChange and
friends from selectBoard. However, since the GUI is not initialized,
there is no real reason to call them either - if we just set the
preferences to the right values, the GUI will be initialized correctly
later. For this reason, selectBoard no longer calls the GUI update
methods. Instead, those are called from the GUI code when the board is
changed through the menu instead (e.g., after calling selectBoard).

This commit slightly changes behaviour. Previously, --board and --port
only worked in combination with --verify and --upload, but were ignored
when just starting the IDE. Now, these are processed regardless of the
other options present.

Additionally, this commit causes all changed preferences to be saved.
Previously, only changes with --pref were saved, --board and --port
options were only active for the current run. This was caused because
the saving of the preferences happened as a side effect of loading the
file in the Editor, but only the --pref option was processed at that
time.

Note that the --verbose options are still only active for the current
run and are only valid combined with --verify or --upload (since they
default to non-verbose instead of the current preference).",2014-08-19 09:16:47+02:00,5.712748555070883,0.7241645943881777,8.353033895527142,0.8192471853257683,8.341070872336084,0.8219037413934447,8.299053799372642,0.8217415574918516,-0.0013056339250754334,-0.00016550594738362623,-0.0016205606693340258,-6.015192454833507e-05,-0.0013440902743475647,-2.9540725366428155e-05,-0.0013418089411274536,-2.5899901567649763e-05

Before, core.a would be rebuilt on every build, even when none of the
core .o files changed. Now, the timestamps are checked against the
timestamp on core.a first, skipping the build if nothing changed.

Because this uses the current list of .o files, there is a corner case
when a source file is deleted, but no other source file is modified. In
that case, core.a is not rebuilt, even though it should be. However,
this is such a narrow and unrealistic case, that it should pose a real
problem.

The documentation for File.delete() says that the method return true
if the the file is successfully deleted, otherwise false is returned.
An exception is thrown only when the file is not accessible (for
permission problem).

Removing the extra check solves another problem, for example in a
folder with the following situation:

    linkToFileA -> FileA
    FileA

if we remove FileA, we remain with a broken link that can't be removed
using FileUtils.deleteIfExists() because calling File.exists() on a
broken link returns *false*.

These key combinations were registered as accelerator keystrokes in the
tab bar popup menu, but also handled by EditorListener. This was
probably added in an attempt to work around the broken accelerator keys
on the tab bar popup menus, but in practice this only meant that the
shortcut would sometimes (and now that the accelerator keys are fixed,
always) switch tabs *twice*. Removing the handling from EditorListener
helps to fix this.

Previously, EditorListener handled these keys, by registering a handler
in the text area. This meant that they would only work while the text
area was focused. By registering the keys as WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW
bindings, they can always be handled, and EditorHeader seems like a more
appropriate place.

Note that this does not currently work (so this commit breaks these
keys), since these keys are also handled in a few different places as
well, preventing these newly added keybindings to take effect. This will
be fixed in the next commit.

One additional change is that previously, these keybindings did not work
when the text area was readonly. This was probably a remnant from when
EditorListener took care of a lot of other editing keybindings, but
this does not make much sense anymore now.

Finally, with the old bindings, ctrl-shift-tab did not (seem to) work.
What happened is that the binding for ctrl-tab did not check the shift
state, so both bindings would fire on ctrl-shift-tab, switching forward
and back again, making it seem the keys did not work. The Swing
keybinding mechanism that is now used for these bindings checks the
complete keystroke, including all modifier keys, so this problem is
fixed by this change.

What happened is that the binding for ctrl-tab did not check the shift
state, so both bindings would fire on ctrl-shift-tab, switching forward
and back again, making it seem the keys did not work. The Swing
keybinding mechanism that is now used for these bindings checks the
complete keystroke, including all modifier keys, so this problem is
fixed by this change.

In the previous commit, these bindings were moved to EditorTab and
registered in a cleaner way, but this move also allows more components
to hijack these keystrokes and prevent them from reaching EditorTab.

This commit makes the keybindings work again, by preventing other
components from handling the keys. In particular:
 - JSplitPane had a binding to switch between its two panes, which is
   now removed after creating the JSplitPane.
 - The default focus traversal manager in Swing uses these keys to
   traverse focus (in addition to the the normal tab and shift-tab
   keys). By removing these keys from the set of ""focus traversal keys""
   defined for the window, this should be prevented when the focus is on
   any component inside the window.
 - JTextPane didn't respond to the previous modification of the
   window-default focus traversal keys, since it defines its own set (to
   only contain ctrl-tab and ctrl-shift-tab, but not tab and shift-tab,
   for undocumented reasons). To fix this, focus traversal is simply
   disabled on the JTextPane, since this wasn't really being used
   anyway.

There was some code in SketchTextArea that tried to modify the focus
traversal keys for just the text area, which is now removed. This code
wasn't really useful, since focus traversal is disabled for the text
area already. Also, the code contained a bug where it would not actually
set the new set of keys for the backward focus traversal.

Previously, this temporary copy was kept around and only deleted when

This commit makes sure the temporary copy is deleted after every build,

This fix a regression introduced in:

048a8a61 (VersionHelper now correctly strip snapshot info)

actually neither 048a8a61 nor the version before are correct becuase:

048a8a61 - strips all the extra `-snapshot` and `+build`
previous - doesn't handle the case `x.y-snapshot`

Now both are handled correctly and a test has been added to verify this.

To be completely semver compliant we should deny versions in the
format `x.y`, but this will break all legacy version that have been
published until now, so this changed should be postponed for the next
major release of the IDE.

For some toolbar buttons, when it is clicked while shift is pressed, its

directly taken from KeyEvent.isShiftDown(). However, to also show the
proper tooltip *before* clicking, EditorToolbar listened to key events
on the main text area, to know when shift is (not) pressed.

This approach means that pressing shift while the text area is not
focused will not change the tooltip, and creates some unwanted coupling
between the toolbar and the text area.

This commit changes this approach to instead use the global

dispatched to the currently focused component, so this makes sure that

RSyntaxTextArea appears to support using a single instance and replacing
the underlying text and document when switching between tabs, but in
practice this support is not complete and even though the
RSyntaxTextArea developers did some work to improve the situation, they
recommend to just use a seperate instance for each tab.

This commit implements exactly that. A new class EditorTab is introduce
to wrap the RSyntaxTextArea and containing scroll pane, and to
encapsulate the code related to handling the text area itself. Doing so
removes some quirks and prepares for some later additions. In
particular, error highlights are now no longer shared between all tabs,
which was previously the case.

This commit mostly moves code from Editor into EditorTab, and updates
the callers to use getCurrentTab() and call methods on the result
instead of calling them on Editor. Some code is added to take care of
creating multiple EditorTab objects and switching between them. Some
small changes have been made to make the flow of opening files work,
though these are mostly a bit hacky.

While moving code, changes to the rest of the code were kept minimal,
retaining existing interfaces as much as possible. This sometimes result
in less than ideal code, which should be cleaned up in subsequent
commits.

The SketchCodeDocument class has been pretty much emptied out, since
it was mostly used to store things for tabs in the background, which are
now just stored in each RSyntaxTextArea separately. The last remaining
bits of this class can probably be moved or implemented differently
later, so it can be removed.

The entire flow of working with sketches and files needs to be cleaned
up next, so no thorough attempt at testing this commit was done. It is
likely that there are plenty of corner cases and race conditions, which
will be fixed once the reset of the code is cleaned up.

RSyntaxTextArea appears to support using a single instance and replacing
the underlying text and document when switching between tabs, but in
practice this support is not complete and even though the
RSyntaxTextArea developers did some work to improve the situation, they
recommend to just use a seperate instance for each tab.

This commit implements exactly that. A new class EditorTab is introduce
to wrap the RSyntaxTextArea and containing scroll pane, and to
encapsulate the code related to handling the text area itself. Doing so
removes some quirks and prepares for some later additions. In
particular, error highlights are now no longer shared between all tabs,
which was previously the case.

This commit mostly moves code from Editor into EditorTab, and updates
the callers to use getCurrentTab() and call methods on the result
instead of calling them on Editor. Some code is added to take care of
creating multiple EditorTab objects and switching between them. Some
small changes have been made to make the flow of opening files work,
though these are mostly a bit hacky.

While moving code, changes to the rest of the code were kept minimal,
retaining existing interfaces as much as possible. This sometimes result
in less than ideal code, which should be cleaned up in subsequent
commits.

The SketchCodeDocument class has been pretty much emptied out, since
it was mostly used to store things for tabs in the background, which are
now just stored in each RSyntaxTextArea separately. The last remaining
bits of this class can probably be moved or implemented differently
later, so it can be removed.

The entire flow of working with sketches and files needs to be cleaned
up next, so no thorough attempt at testing this commit was done. It is
likely that there are plenty of corner cases and race conditions, which

Handling of external editor mode has also changed. When the Arduino
application is activated, instead of fully reloading the sketch (through
the now-absent `Sketch.load()` method), the new `SketchData.reload()`
method is called to reload the list of files in the sketch. If it
changed, all tabs are re-created. If not, only the current tab is
reloaded. When the user switches from one tab to another, that tab is
also reloaded. This ensures that the visible  tab is always up-to-date,
without needlessly reloading all tabs all the time. When external
editing mode is enabled or disabled, all tabs are reloaded too, to make
sure they are up-to-date.

When re-creating all tabs, no attempt is made to preserve the currently
selected tab. Since adding or removing files happens rarely, this should
not be a problem. When files are changed, the currently selected tab is
implicitly preserved (because the tab is reloaded, not recreated). The
caret (and thus scroll) position is preserved by temporarily changing
the caret update policy, so the caret does not move while the text is
swapped out. This happens in `EditorTab.setText()` now, so other callers
can also profit from it.

To support checking for a changed list of files in
`SketchData.reload()`, a `SketchCode.equals()` method is added, that
just checks if the filenames are equal. Additionally, the loading of the
file list for a sketch has now moved from `SketchData.load()` to
`SketchData.listSketchFiles()`, so `reload()` can also use it. At the
same time, this loading is greatly simplified by using a sorted Set and
`FileUtils.listFiles()`.

In external editor mode, to ensure that during compilation the version
from disk is always used instead of the in-memory version, EditorTab
detaches itself from its SketchCode, so SketchCode has no access to the
(possibly outdated) in-memory contents of the file.",2016-08-26 16:42:44+02:00,5.44988945620112,0.8220842185037972,6.393016223038566,0.8515171937187366,6.136877442033962,0.8361039312277657,6.105711294193348,0.8338939163383406,-0.02603627374351447,-0.0003477129736136897,-0.06258384863363808,-0.0038810241819174918,-0.07166086974886099,-0.0047393726015826365,-0.07283908142014806,-0.004862548002131151

Before, `getPrettyName()` would return the extension-less name for all
files. There were a lot of places that checked for .ino and/or .pde
files and and called `getPrettyName()` for those, and `getFileName()`
for others. By moving this check into `getPrettyName()`, all those
callers become more simple, and more consistent (there were 5 different
checks to basically achieve the same thing).

There are small changes in behaviour, where .pde is now also hidden but
was not before. Also, the print header now shows extensions for other
files, which makes it more consistent with the tab names. For cases
where the old behaviour was still required, `Sketch.getBaseName()` was
added.

At the same time, the actual handling of the filenames is simplified by
using methods from FileUtils.

should prevent this from happening, and with the old code, some internal

This commits replaces a significant part of the code handling these
features. A lot of responsibilities are moved from SketchController to
Sketch, though the code involved is rewritten mostly.

Most of the handling now happens inside Sketch, including various checks
against the new filename. Basically SketchController processes the user
input to decide what needs to be done, and Sketch checks if it can be
done and does it.

If problems occur, an IOException is thrown, using a translated error
message that is shown by SketchController as-is. This might not be the
best way to transfer error messages (regular IOExceptions might contain
less-friendly messages), so this might need further improvement later.

In addition to moving around code and responsibilities, this code also
changes behaviour in some places:
 - Because Sketch and SketchFile are now in control of renames and
   saves, they can update their internal state after a rename. This
   removes the need for reloading the entire sketch after a rename or
   save as and allows `Editor.handleOpenUnchecked()` to be removed.
 - When renaming the entire sketch, all files used to be saved before
   renaming, since the sketch would be re-opened after renaming. Since
   the re-opening no longer happens, there is no longer a need to save
   the sketch, so any unsaved changes remain unsaved in the editor after
   renaming the sketch.
 - When renaming or adding new files, duplicate filenames are detected.
   Initially, this happened case sensitively, but it was later changed to
   use case insensitive matching to prevent problems on Windows (where
   filenames cannot differ in just case). To prevent complexity, this
   did not distinguish between systems. In commit 5fbf9621f6 (Sketch
   rename: allowig a case change rename if NOT on windows), the
   intention was to only do case insensitive checking on Windows, but it
   effectively disabled all checking on other systems, making the check
   not catch duplicate filenames at all.

   With this commit, all these checks are done using `File.equals()`
   instead of comparing strings, which is already aware of the case
   sensitivity of the platform and should act accordingly.
 - Some error messages were changed.
 - When adding a file, an empty file is not created directly, but only a
   SketchFile and EditorTab is added. When the sketch is saved, the file
   is created.
 - When importing a file that already exists (thus overwriting it),
   instead of replacing the SketchFile instance, this just lets the
   EditorTab reload its contents. This was broken since the introduction
   of EditorTab. The file would be replaced, but not this was not
   reflected in the editor, which is now fixed. This change allows
   `Sketch.replaceFile()` to be removed.
 - When importing a file that does not exist yet (thus adding it), a tab
   is now also added for it (in addition to a SketchFile). This was
   broken since the introduction of EditorTab, and would result in the
   file being added, but not shown in the editor.

This commit adds a `Sketch.renameFileTo()` method, to rename a single
file within the sketch. It would be better to integrate its contents
into `Sketch.renameTo()`, but that does not have access to the `Sketch`
instance it is contained in. This will be changed in a future commit.",2016-08-26 16:42:44+02:00,5.510426372237167,0.7075623160682903,8.193920560243365,0.8162154280737949,8.135336713888284,0.814803260445989,8.087646382513668,0.8146481935235881,0.16143666975638382,-0.057816284085910996,0.4874130511853245,-0.03899633061534591,0.5504404314091502,-0.035345978480731066,0.542518915057264,-0.0347755000242993

message that is shown by SketchController as-is. This might not be the
best way to transfer error messages (regular IOExceptions might contain
less-friendly messages), so this might need further improvement later.

In addition to moving around code and responsibilities, this code also
changes behaviour in some places:
 - Because Sketch and SketchFile are now in control of renames and
   saves, they can update their internal state after a rename. This
   removes the need for reloading the entire sketch after a rename or
   save as and allows `Editor.handleOpenUnchecked()` to be removed.
 - When renaming the entire sketch, all files used to be saved before
   renaming, since the sketch would be re-opened after renaming. Since
   the re-opening no longer happens, there is no longer a need to save
   the sketch, so any unsaved changes remain unsaved in the editor after
   renaming the sketch.
 - When renaming or adding new files, duplicate filenames are detected.
   Initially, this happened case sensitively, but it was later changed to
   use case insensitive matching to prevent problems on Windows (where
   filenames cannot differ in just case). To prevent complexity, this
   did not distinguish between systems. In commit 5fbf9621f6 (Sketch
   rename: allowig a case change rename if NOT on windows), the
   intention was to only do case insensitive checking on Windows, but it
   effectively disabled all checking on other systems, making the check
   not catch duplicate filenames at all.

   With this commit, all these checks are done using `File.equals()`
   instead of comparing strings, which is already aware of the case
   sensitivity of the platform and should act accordingly.
 - Some error messages were changed.
 - When adding a file, an empty file is not created directly, but only a
   SketchFile and EditorTab is added. When the sketch is saved, the file
   is created.
 - When importing a file that already exists (thus overwriting it),
   instead of replacing the SketchFile instance, this just lets the
   EditorTab reload its contents. This was broken since the introduction
   of EditorTab. The file would be replaced, but not this was not
   reflected in the editor, which is now fixed. This change allows
   `Sketch.replaceFile()` to be removed.
 - When importing a file that does not exist yet (thus adding it), a tab
   is now also added for it (in addition to a SketchFile). This was
   broken since the introduction of EditorTab, and would result in the

This commit adds a `Sketch.renameFileTo()` method, to rename a single
file within the sketch. It would be better to integrate its contents
into `Sketch.renameTo()`, but that does not have access to the `Sketch`
instance it is contained in.

Previously, everywhere where it was needed, the path was requested from
BaseNoGui. Because the path is based on a hash of the sketch filename,
every caller would get the same path for the same sketch.

However, it makes more sense to store the path used for a given sketch
inside the Sketch object. This prevents having to pass around or
regenerate the build path everywhere, and no longer requires the build

The snippet:

    boolean wrapNeeded = false;
    if (wrap && nextIndex == -1) {
      // if wrapping, a second chance is ok, start from the end
      wrapNeeded = true;
    }

Can be moved inside the `if (nextIndex == -1)` that follows, this way:

    if (nextIndex == -1) {
      boolean wrapNeeded = false;
      if (wrap) {
        // if wrapping, a second chance is ok, start from the end
        wrapNeeded = true;

      if (wrapNeeded) {
        nextIndex = backwards ? text.lastIndexOf(search) : text.indexOf(search, 0);
      }
    }

but since `wrapNeeded` is used only at the very end of the `if` statement
we can move it forward:

    if (nextIndex == -1) {
      [...CUT...]

      boolean wrapNeeded = false;
      if (wrap) {
        // if wrapping, a second chance is ok, start from the end
        wrapNeeded = true;
      }
      if (wrapNeeded) {
        nextIndex = backwards ? text.lastIndexOf(search) : text.indexOf(search, 0);
      }
    }

and finally simplify it by removing `wrapNeeded` altogether:

    if (nextIndex == -1) {
      [...CUT...]

      if (wrap) {
        nextIndex = backwards ? text.lastIndexOf(search) : text.indexOf(search, 0);

This regression originates from:

8725bb1e Clean up sketch loading

before this commit the sketch name sanitization was made on the sketch
name without the extension.
After 8725bb1e instead the name sanitization is made on the filename, so
including the "".ino"" extension.

This lead to a weird corner case, caused by the limit of 63 characters
on the sketch name: before 8725bb1e it would be possible to save a sketch
with a name of exactly 63 characters, but after 8725bb1e this sketch will
suddenly becomes invalid becuase the 63 chars name + extension would exceed
the 63 characters limit.

This commit fix this regression.

the user needed to manually delete the corrupted file from the
staging folder (without knowing the exact path of the file to
remove).

The properties:

      System.setProperty(""awt.useSystemAAFontSettings"", ""on"");
      System.setProperty(""swing.aatext"", ""true"");

actually works on Linux (where the hint helps X11 to enable antialiased
rendering) but makes things worse on Windows where the outcome is exactly
the opposite (anti-alias is disabled).

Previously those settings had no effect because they were executed
*after* the initialization of the graphics. This is no more true
after the merge of #5578, that moved the graphics initialization
after commmand line parsing and consequently revealed the weird
behaviour on windows.

Before 72f815bcf (Refactor file adding and renaming, and save as handling)
renaming a file would first save it and then rename it. Since that
commit, renaming an unsaved, newly added file would try to rename a
non-existing file on disk, causing an error message.

This is fixed by only moving the on-disk file if it exists, otherwise
just the in-memory filename is updated and the file will be written
during the next save.

This commits adds the ""CTRL SHIFT ="" as key to increase font size.
The old shortcut ""CTRL +"" is still active, but it's not always
possible to produce it if the keyboard layout doesn't have the + key
on the base layer.

This add the possibility to compose ""CTRL +"" when the keyboard has
the ""+"" available as ""SHIFT ="", that seems to be very common in
many layouts.

The swing UIManager class detects the correct look and feel settings by
looking inside the `sun.desktop` system property, here's the extract of
the JDK:

    String desktop = AccessController.doPrivileged(new GetPropertyAction(""sun.desktop""));
    Toolkit toolkit = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit();
    if (""gnome"".equals(desktop) &&
            toolkit instanceof SunToolkit &&
            ((SunToolkit) toolkit).isNativeGTKAvailable()) {
        // May be set on Linux and Solaris boxs.
        return ""com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel"";
    }

Now ```tar.xz``` format is widely used, and the official arduino
IDE download URL also shows that arduino uses ```tar.xz``` format.
(https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.9-linux64.tar.xz).

As we all know, the tar.xz format has the optimal size compared to tar,
tar.gz, tar.bz2, and zip.
(https://www.rootusers.com/gzip-vs-bzip2-vs-xz-performance-comparison/)

Therefore, it is very unreasonable not to support tar.xz.

Supporting this format can save almost half of the bandwidth resources
and download time when compressing the gcc toolchain,
making users more comfortable.

Previously, for the boards manager:
 - InstallerJDialog would set the ""selection background"" color on the
   table, using the ""status.notice.bgcolor"" the color (default blueish
   green). This color is not used directly, but made available for cell
   renderers to use.
   https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/a1448876a1115c9d3ee9e88f29a15bb081a27816/app/src/cc/arduino/contributions/ui/InstallerJDialog.java#L183
 - For each cell, either a ContributedPlatformTableCellEditor or
   ContributedPlatformTableCellRenderer is used, depending on whether
   the cell is being edited (i.e. when selected).
 - Both of these create a ContributedPlatformTableCellJPanel, and call
   its `update` method, which creates the components for the cell.
 - The `update` method als sets the background color of the description
   to white, which does not actually have any effect because the
   description is not opaque.
   https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/a1448876a1115c9d3ee9e88f29a15bb081a27816/app/src/cc/arduino/contributions/packages/ui/ContributedPlatformTableCellJPanel.java#L271

   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#setBackground(java.awt.Color)
 - The `update` method also sets its colors of itself (JPanel) to the FG
   and BG color, or the selected FG and BG color of the table depending
   on the selected status of the cell. These seem to default to black on
   white for non-selected and white on blue-ish for selected cells.
   However, InstallJDialog has replaced the selected BG with a blueish
   green, as shown above.
   Of these, only the BG colors actually seem to take effect. The fg
   color of the description component is actually used (default black).
   https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/a1448876a1115c9d3ee9e88f29a15bb081a27816/app/src/cc/arduino/contributions/packages/ui/ContributedPlatformTableCellJPanel.java#L282-L288
 - After calling `update`, ContributedPlatformTableCellEditor overrides
   the JPanel background color with a fixed grey color. Similarly,
   ContributedPlatformTableCellRenderer sets an alternating white and
   (slightly lighter) grey background color. Together, this means that
   the background color set by ContributedPlatformTableCellJPanel is
   never actually used.
   https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/blob/a1448876a1115c9d3ee9e88f29a15bb081a27816/app/src/cc/arduino/contributions/packages/ui/ContributedPlatformTableCellEditor.java#L132-L133

For the library manager, pretty much the same happens.

Effectively, the only colors that were actually used were the background
colors set by ContributedPlatformTableCellEditor and
ContributedPlatformTableCellRenderer. This is problematic because:
 - There is a lot of other confusing and unused code
 - The foreground color is never set. This is fine when it is black or
   another dark color, but when the system is configured with a dark
   theme, the default foreground color will be white, which is
   problematic on a white background.

This commit remove the unneeded code, setting the foreground color
is left for later. It also removes the (now unused) `isSelected` from
`ContributedPlatformTableCellJPanel::update`. For the library manager,
the corresponding argument is still used to decide the ""author"" color.",2019-10-16 17:30:40+02:00,5.195519139696204,0.7562217366549417,7.161428600233728,0.8884380034832104,7.05039861357217,0.8857282540558897,6.972281284983639,0.8845105938861582,-0.16414516986457706,-0.07143189774750747,0.08825095522307347,-0.01827503421169918,0.12385444425808778,-0.01622657616238865,0.11462946893754733,-0.01694254844045584

Previously, only the background color was changed to white or light

This commit fixes this by also overriding the text color to be black.
Since the colors are set on the JPanel table cell, but the actual text
is rendered by the description JTextPane, the `setForeground` method is
overridden to forward the foreground color to the description pane.

Note that this commit only touches the table cell and description
inside, the dropdowns and buttons have neither background nor foreground
color set (thus these use both colors from the system theme). It might
be more consistent to also override these, but such native UI components
are typically tricky to colorize properly, so best let the system handle
that normally.

An alternative solution would be only use the default colors, which
would actually preserve the dark theme colors in these managers as well
(rather than forcing black-on-white/grey as now). There are default
colors for selected and non-selected table cells that could be used, but
these are different from the current colors. Additionally, the current
odd/even alternating colors are then also no longer available.",2019-10-16 17:30:40+02:00,5.347048638945471,0.8320616786031163,6.976295781607944,0.897297344368144,6.825101090396259,0.8920474420876117,6.752769022362301,0.8911689143654788,0.13482085680648126,0.07476135883391555,-0.20454047974108835,0.007639939204389656,-0.24003144588916037,0.005753277291400627,-0.2338953675701827,0.006200495917139892

but not for a dark theme with white or light text.

This commit fixes this by also overriding the text color to be black.
Since the colors are set on the JPanel table cell, but the actual text
is rendered by the description JTextPane, the `setForeground` method is
overridden to forward the foreground color to the description pane.

Note that this commit only touches the table cell and description
inside, the dropdowns and buttons have neither background nor foreground
color set (thus these use both colors from the system theme). It might
be more consistent to also override these, but such native UI components
are typically tricky to colorize properly, so best let the system handle
that normally.

An alternative solution would be only use the default colors, which
would actually preserve the dark theme colors in these managers as well
(rather than forcing black-on-white/grey as now). There are default
colors for selected and non-selected table cells that could be used, but
these are different from the current colors. Additionally, the current
odd/even alternating colors are then also no longer available.",2019-10-16 17:30:40+02:00,5.2122277821389895,0.7573003197692008,7.180836261349032,0.8896574051637544,7.065132536285419,0.886294164796211,6.986664389932484,0.884968418448339,0.13369383617880537,-0.12932755613196067,0.2552171993537673,-0.048302565559112054,0.2660092573440096,-0.050561274972980574,0.29948129048038474,-0.04901248496563526

Error messages are detected and parsed using a regex. Part of this regex
matches the optional column number.

The code that handled this assumed that a missing column would result in
less elements in the matches array, but a regex always results in one
element per set of parenthesis in the regex, which will be null if no
capture was made for that element.

In practice, this meant that if no column was present in the error
message, a NullPointerException would be raised. Furthermore, gcc 9
seems to have started outputting omitting column numbers (instead of
printing 0) for some errors (such as unterminated #ifdef), which exposed
this problem.

This commit fixes this by simply using the fixed match numbers to take
apart the regex match, and by checking for a null column number (all
other captures are non-optional, so no need to check there).",2020-01-29 19:04:43+01:00,5.449914315143074,0.7338701884675394,8.011849011689952,0.876123393454327,7.911704985926024,0.8726701028105085,7.900577732415928,0.8745940194620891,-0.005774039167667944,0.001682055232762103,-0.0023615705494215433,-0.00025824590561085436,-0.002732761458537958,-0.00030142671234856255,-0.0029129160279701694,-0.00032245982807110884

When the serial device disconnects, the serial monitor and plotter are
disabled. Previously, the window would be completely disabled. Now, the
configuration controls (autoscroll, add timestamp, baudrate, line
endings) can still be changed while the window is disconnected. These
settings will not take effect immediately, but will be used when the
port is next opened.

Previously, the programmers menu always showed *all* programmers of
*all* platforms. This made it hard to find the programmer you need.

When selecting a programmer from another platform, it would typically
not work, since the tool definitions rely on specific variables to be
defined by the board, or files available in the variant directory, which
are typically platform-dependent. Also, some programmers might be
defined in multiple platforms, but there is currently no way to tell
which one is for the current platform an will work, and which is for
another platform and will break.

This commit changes the programmer menu to only show programmers from
the platforms that define the board and the core used. The latter is
only used when boar definition refers a core in another platform, in
which case the core and variant already have a strong coupling (the
variant must offer the right variables for the core to work), so that
would also apply to the programmer, so programmers from the referenced
core's platform can be expected to work.

When a board is selected, the menu of available programmers is
refreshed, but the currently selected programmer preference is
untouched. This might mean that a programmer is selected that is invalid
for the current board and will not actually work. This could be fixed by
clearing the current programmer when it becomes invalid, but that would
mean that changing to another platform and back would always require
reselecting the programmer to use, which seems counter-productive. An
alternative fix would be to check the programmer against the board and
throw an error, but that would require duplicating some code, which did
not seem worthwile (ideally, all this code will be moved to arduino-cli
anyway in the future).

This fixes #9373.",2020-03-23 12:05:38+01:00,5.535088528925689,0.7072196049016758,8.454094974635643,0.8314888650568096,8.422385502071505,0.8325523068752249,8.377565908228892,0.833038451374162,-0.003386188306794047,-0.0004326541019061825,0.0011646186777589662,0.00011454419018230855,0.000944268139296156,9.334084951195809e-05,0.0007452732177970489,7.410759330395145e-05

This fixes a problem with the Serial UTF-8 decoder. This decoding moves
data from char[] buf, into a ByteBuffer inFromSerial, then decodes them
into a CharBuffer outToMessage and converts to a char[] to pass on.

When the buf read contained just over a full buffer worth of bytes and
contained some multi-byte characters, a situation could arise where two
decodes were needed to fill up outToMessage, leaving some data in
inFromSerial. If in this case no data would be left in buf, decoding
would stop until more data came in from serial.

This commit fixes this problem by:
 - Changing the outer loop to continue running when buf is empty, but
   inFromSerial is not.
 - Changing the inner loop to run at least once (so it runs when buf is
   empty, but inFromSerial is no).
 - Breaking out of the outer loop when no characters were produced (this
   handles the case where only an incomplete UTF-8 character remains in
   inFromSerial, which would otherwise prevent the loop from
   terminating.
 - Removes a `if (outToMessage.hasRemaining()` check that is now
   necessarily true if the break was not done.

Previously, this code only looked at direct children of the submenu.
Now, this code also looks through submenus recursively, to keep the code

This makes a small behaviour change: previously, the first selected item

which makes the code a bit cleaner. I cannot quickly see any case where

This commit changes the board menu to have a submenu for each platform,

Note that this first keeps a list of board items and then adds those to

The tests would initialize Base, PreferencesData with default settings
and/or run the arduino executable, without specifying any settings to
use. In practice, this would read settings from e.g. `~/.arduino15`,
load libraries from the user's sketchbook, etc.

This is not a good idea, since this can be influence the test. For
example, the presence of invalid libraries would cause extra output to
be generated, which breaks the `--version` test. Or having the ""Use
external editor"" setting set would break tests that try to edit a
sketch.

This commit fixes this. The core of this commit is in
`AbstractWithPreferencesTest`, which sets up a clean settings dir (to
replace `~/.arduino15`) with a sketchbook and `preferences.txt` file
inside before every test (and removes it again after the test.

For some tests, this is enough, but some tests create an instance of
`Base`, which again initializes everything, including preferences, from
the default location. To prevent that, `--preferences-file` is passed to
the `Base` constructor, loading the previously set up preferences. This
is handled by the new `AbstractWithPreferencesTest.createBase()` method.

Furthermore, CommandLineTest calls the actual Arduino executable, which
has the same problem. This is fixed by passing the same
`--preferences-file` option on the commandline (generated by
`AbstractWithPreferencesTest.getBaseArgs()`).

This is not a good idea, since this can be influence the test. For

be generated, which breaks the `--version` test. Or having the ""Use

`Base`, which again initializes everything, including preferences, from

the `Base` constructor, loading the previously set up preferences. This
is handled by the new `AbstractWithPreferencesTest.createBase()` method.

removes the internal call to rescanLibraries() from setLibrariesFolder().

The existing setLibrariesFolder()+rescanLibraries() combos have been
replaced with setLibrariesFoldersAndRescan().
